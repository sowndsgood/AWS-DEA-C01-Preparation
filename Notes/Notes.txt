Data Sampling:
- Statistical technique to select smaller dataset from larger dataset
- Population: complete set
- Sample: subset from population
- Sampling Frame: list of population elements Ex: Database of all population
- Sampling Error: difference between population and sample due to sampling
- Sample Size: Total number of units in sample

Data Skewness:
- Asymmetry in distribution of data values
- Negative skew, Positive skew

Data Validation: ensure data is correct and consistent

Data Profiling: Analysing data
